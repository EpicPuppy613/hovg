            <h4>EQ: How did the quality of video games improve throughout the 1950s to the 1980s?</h4><br><hr>
            <br><br><br><br>
            <p>
                From the old times of the stone age to the modern computer chips of the present, games have always been a staple part of humanity.<br><br><br>
                The forms of games can range anywhere from oral games to hand games, board games to card games. But the problem with physical games is that they have to be done manually. <br><br><br>
                The invention of logic gates and logical circuits would allow for basic games to be played on a device.<br><br><br>
                To fully understand how modern games we play today evolved, we have to go back to the 1950s<br><br>

            <h2>1950-1959 Early History</h2>
            <h3>Period Highlights:</h3>
            <li>The first computer games</li>
            <li><i>Bertie the Brain</i> and <i>Nimrod</i> are some of the earliest computer games</li><br>
            <p>
                Some of the first computer games emerged throughout 1940 - 1950. <br>
                One of the first major games was <i>Bertie the Brain</i> the 13 foot tall computer could let you play the game of tic-tac-toe against an artificial intelligence. <br>
                Comprised of a simple button panel and a light-up display, the game was put on display at the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. <br>
                After receiving a lot of popularity, the game was disassembled after the exhibition and mostly forgotten. <br><br>
                The next major computer game was <i>Nimrod</i>. <br>
                <i>Nimrod</i> was a 12ft by 9ft computer that ran the game of Nim. <br>
                It was shown off in 1951 at the Festival of Britain. It would make another appearance a few weeks later at the Berlin Industrial Show.<br><br>
                Two more notable games were <i>OXO</i> and a checkers program. <br>
                These games were unique as they were the first to use a computer screen to display the board rather than using light bulbs. <br>

            <h2>1960-1969 The Start of the Revolution</h2>
            <h3>Period Highlights:</h3>
            <li>The BASIC programming language was invented allowing for more complicated programs and games</li>
            <li>The first major football computer game was created</li>
            <li>The first home console, the <i>Odyssey</i>, was invented</li>
            <p>
                With the advancement of technology, there is even more opportunity to create. <br><br>
                The BASIC language was created in the mid 1960s. <br>
                John Kemeny wanted a language that would allow for everyone to be able to program. <br>
                The BASIC language was created to make it easy for students to create games. <br><br>
                The first home console was created by Ralph Baer in 1967. <br>
                Nicknamed the "Brown Box", the prototype of a console was able to let users play games like tennis on their television. <br>
                Ralph Baer patented and sold his console to Magnavox who released it as <i>Odyssey</i>.<br>

            <h2>1970-1974 The Dawn of the Home Console</h2>
            <h3>Period Highlights:</h3>
            <li>Conway's game of life was implemented on computers</li>
            <li>The game <i>Oregon Trail</i> was created to simulate a journey on the Oregon Trail</li>
            <li>The first computer arcade game, <i>Pong</i>, was created based off of a game on the <i>Odyssey</i></li>
            <li>The home version of <i>Pong</i> was released</li>
            <p>
                The game of life was implemented onto computers allowing for users to watch patterns emerge from the simulation.<br><br>
                College students Don Rawisch, Bill Heinemann, and Paul Dillenberger created <i>Oregon Trail</i>.<br>
                The game simulated the journey that pioneers had to make as they travelled westward on the Oregon Trail.<br><br>
                Nolan Bushnell and Al Alcorn created <i>Pong</i> a table tennis arcade game.<br>
                The game was hugely successful and had millions of games played.<br>
                A home version of <i>Pong</i> was released by Atari a few years later.<br>

            <h3>Period Highlights:</h3>
            <li><i>Adventure</i> was created: a text-based adventuring/exploration game</li>
            <li>The Video Computer System also known as the <i>Atari 2600</i> was created, the first console to introduce interchangeable game cartridges and games in color</li>
            <li>Another arcade game <i>Space Invaders</i> took Japan by storm later causing a similar frenzy in America</li>
            <li>A handheld console, <i>IntelliVision</i>, was created with better graphics and more controls than the <i>Atari 2600</i> which was especially known for the selection of sports games</li>
            <p>
                Don Woods created the text-based adventure game, <i>Adventure</i>.<br>
                The game allowed players to explore a fictional world and collect treasures.<br>
                It was inspired by Dungeons and Dragons and inspired many other iconic text-based games like <i>Zork</i>.<br><br>
                Atari releases the <i>Atari 2600</i> as a home console.<br>
                The console featured cartridges that could easily be switched out to play different games and allowed for colors to be displayed.<br><br>
                Another arcade game, <i>Space Invaders</i>, developed by Taito took Japan by storm.<br>
                The game was super popular and causes a shortage of coins in the Japanese economy.<br>
                The game would later be released in the United States which had similar results to the Japanese releases.<br>

            <h3>Period Highlights:</h3>
            <li><i>Pac-Man</i> was created and released</li>
            <li>The creation of <i>Donkey Kong</i> and the introduction of Jumpman, who would turn into Mario in future games</li>
            <li>The video game market crash due to an over saturated market with too many low quality games</li>
            <p>
                A missing slice from a pizza would inspire Toru Iwatani to create <i>Pac-Mac</i>.<br>
                The game was massively successful and later released to home consoles.<br><br>
                Nintendo would create the arcade game <i>Donkey Kong</i> and introduce Jumpman.<br>
                Jumpman would later inspire Mario in the future games from Nintendo.<br><br>
                With the explosion in popularity of video games, more and more third party developers started making games.<br>
                As more and more developers started making games, the market was flooded with low quality games.<br>
                All of these factors led to the crash of the video game market in 1983.<br>
                During this time, many people questioned the point of video games in the first place.<br>
                As a result of the crash, many games were made that did not sell well.<br>
                Most of the third party developers went out of buisness and were forced to file for bankruptcy.<br>

            <h3>Period Highlights:</h3>
            <li>The market started recovering with the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</li>
            <li>The company Nintendo released several well-known franchises like <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>, <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>, and <i>Metroid</i> which further aided in the recovery of the market</li>
            <li>A new handheld console, the Game Boy, would be introduced to the market along with the franchise of <i>Tetris</i></li>
            <li>Another home console, the Sega Genesis, would be released but failed to adequately gather enough attention to compete against the NES</li>
            <p>
                Nintendo would release the Famicon (Family Computer) in Japan during 1985.<br>
                The Famicon would be renamed to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and released in North America.<br>
                The release of the NES would start the recovery of the North American video game market.<br><br>
                In 1889, Nintendo, a Japanese company that made playing cards, created several video game franchises that still exist today like <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> and <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>.<br>
                Nintendo also had stricter regulations when it came to making games for the NES to combat low quality and rushed games.<br>
                These changes would allow third-party developers to also make some long lasting franchises.<br><br>
                Sega released the Sega Genesis in 1989.<br>
                The console was an attempt from Sega to take advantage of the expanding market by offering better graphics and more games oriented to an older demographic.<br>
                The Genesis would only capture a quarter of the market compared to the NES.<br><br>
                Nintendo would release the Game Boy in 1989 which would popularize handheld gaming consoles and would inspire many more consoles in later decades.<br>

            <li>Computer gaming would become more popular as more people would own a personal computer</li>
            <li>More companies would try to create consoles to compete with Nintendo</li>
            <li>More and more third party developers would creates games to go along with the consoles</li>
